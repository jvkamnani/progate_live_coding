# Progate Live Coding session Code


The code here was part of a project taken up by me in partnership with progate to organize a week of learning to teach college students the basics of web development(htmls,css and js). A part of my responsibility was to have a live coding session to teach the following:
1) Combining html, css and js in a single project.
2) Live Debugging of code and how various tools associated with it
3) Basics of version control


The code here is to build a simple calculator app which takes two numbers and performs the specified operation on them
